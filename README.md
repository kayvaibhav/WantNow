## Introduction
Want Now is a college cafetaria automation website designed to help students place food orders without having to wait in line. The application was developed to maintain social distancing during the COVID pandemic and improve the overall experience of ordering food.
## UX Research and Prototyping
The development of Want Now started with UX research, which helped us understand the needs and requirements of the users. The following steps were taken to perform the UX research and prototype the design:

<ins>**Identifying User Needs**</ins>: We conducted surveys and interviews with college students to understand their needs and requirements when ordering food from the cafeteria. This helped us identify pain points and areas for improvement in the existing ordering process.

<ins>**Competitor Analysis**</ins>: We also analyzed the websites of similar cafetaria automation systems to understand the best practices and features that can be incorporated into Want Now.

<ins>**Creating Personas**</ins>: Based on the findings of our research, we created personas that represented the different types of users who would use the Want Now system. This helped us focus on the needs and requirements of specific user groups during the design phase.

<ins>**Wireframing**</ins>: After conducting the research and creating personas, we started to wireframe the user interface. This involved creating a simple, low-fidelity version of the interface to help us visualize the layout and flow of the application.

<ins>**Prototyping**</ins>: Using Figma, we created a high-fidelity prototype of the user interface that incorporated the design elements and features identified in the wireframing phase.

<ins>**User Testing**</ins>: After creating the prototype, we conducted user testing to gather feedback on the design and ensure that it met the needs of the users. This involved having users perform tasks using the prototype and providing feedback on their experience.

The UX research and prototyping phase was an iterative process that allowed us to continually refine the design until it met the needs of the users. The final design was a result of several rounds of user testing and feedback, which helped us create a user-friendly and efficient interface for Want Now.
## Implementation
The final design was implemented using HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript. The implementation phase involved creating a responsive and user-friendly interface that allowed students to easily place food orders.

## Migration to Bootstrap5 Framework
To optimize the project and add new features, we decided to migrate the project to the Bootstrap5 framework. Bootstrap5 provides a robust set of tools and components that made it easier to develop and maintain the application.

## Conclusion
Want Now is a simple and intuitive college cafetaria automation website that provides students with a convenient way to place food orders. The project was developed with the user in mind and provides a seamless experience that makes ordering food a breeze. We are confident that Want Now will improve the overall experience of ordering food at college cafeterias.
